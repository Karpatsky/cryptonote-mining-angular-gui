# cryptonote-mining-angular-gui
Alternative angularjs based UI for cryptonote-universal-pool
## usage
Simple host the files from this repro rather than the files from the pool software.
## config
Very much the same as the pools configuration with a few changes. There is also a seperate coinConfig.js file. This can be hosted either with the rest of the config, or where coin operators support it, on the coin operators website (allowing coin operators to keep downloads and info up to date).
## coins supporting remote coinConfig.js
